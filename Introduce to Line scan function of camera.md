For the Line scan function, simulating the line scan by collecting frames from the ZED's right camera, extracting the middle column of each frame and arranging these columns horizontally to form a continuous 2D image.
Example:
1. Previous Line scan image	= [ |A|B| ]
2. Middle column from Frame	= [ |C| ]
3. New Line scan image 	= [ |A|B|C| ]
